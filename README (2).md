## üîç About

Stored procedures and user-defined functions in SQL allow you to:
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Create reusable logic for complex calculations
- Improve database performance
- Simplify data operations and streamline data workflows

These examples showcase various use cases and best practices for leveraging these SQL features to enhance productivity in data management tasks.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Stored Procedures**: Examples and use cases for automating tasks like data manipulation, error handling, and transaction management.
- **User Defined Functions**: Examples of scalar, inline table-valued, and multi-statement table-valued functions.
- **Error Handling**: Includes try-catch methods for robust error management in stored procedures.
- **Parameterization**: Demonstrates how to create parameterized stored procedures and UDFs for dynamic data processing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To use these SQL scripts:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sql-stored-procedures-udfs.git
   ```
2. Open the SQL files in your preferred SQL editor (e.g., SQL Server Management Studio, MySQL Workbench).
3. Run the scripts on your SQL database as required.

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Stored Procedures**: Stored procedures are located in the `stored_procedures` folder. Each script includes a description of its purpose and parameter details.
2. **User Defined Functions**: UDFs can be found in the `user_defined_functions` folder. Each function includes details on input parameters, return types, and example usage.

To create a stored procedure:
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name (@param1 datatype, @param2 datatype)
AS
BEGIN
   -- Procedure logic here
END;
```

To create a user-defined function:
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION function_name (@param datatype)
RETURNS datatype
AS
BEGIN
   -- Function logic here
   RETURN result;
END;
```

## üìÇ Folder Structure

- `stored_procedures/`: Contains SQL scripts for different stored procedures.
- `user_defined_functions/`: Contains SQL scripts for various UDFs (scalar, inline, and multi-statement).
- `examples/`: Demonstrates example usage of stored procedures and UDFs in common scenarios.

## üìò Examples

1. **Stored Procedure**: Automate repetitive data entry tasks.
2. **User Defined Function**: Calculate monthly totals for a specified column.
3. **Error Handling**: Manage errors gracefully in stored procedures.
4. **Parameterized Procedures and Functions**: Process data dynamically based on user inputs.

Each example includes comments and descriptions to explain its purpose and usage.

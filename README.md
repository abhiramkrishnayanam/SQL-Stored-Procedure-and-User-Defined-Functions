## üìã Introduction
Stored Procedures and User Defined Functions (UDFs) are essential tools in SQL that help automate tasks, improve query performance, and encapsulate complex logic. Stored Procedures allow for procedural operations that modify data and manage transactions, while UDFs provide reusable code blocks for calculations and data transformation.

## üîë Key Concepts
### Stored Procedures
Stored Procedures are SQL routines that perform specified actions on a database, such as modifying data or managing transactions. They are especially useful for:
- Automating repetitive tasks
- Ensuring consistent data operations
- Boosting scalability and performance

### User Defined Functions (UDFs)
UDFs allow you to create custom functions to perform calculations, transformations, or other operations. They are especially useful for:
- Modularizing complex calculations
- Reusing logic across multiple queries
- Enhancing data analysis by embedding logic directly into SQL queries

## üìù Examples
This repository contains examples for:
1. **Creating a Stored Procedure**: Learn how to define parameters, handle transactions, and manage data.
2. **Creating a User Defined Function**: Learn how to create scalar and table-valued functions that perform calculations or return modified data sets.

### Example Structure
Each example includes:
- **SQL Code**: Ready-to-use SQL scripts
- **Explanation**: Line-by-line comments explaining each part of the script
- **Use Cases**: Real-world applications and examples
